<h2>A brief summary of Bhagat Singh journey</h2>
<p>
    Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan;
     he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu.Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle
      Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement 
      of 1914–1915.

<h2>Killing of John Saunders</h2>
<p>
    In 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission
     because there were no Indians in its membership, and there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, 
     Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it. Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott,
    ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928.
     Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received. When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the  United Kingdom, 
     the British Government denied any role in Rai's death
</p>
<h2>Escape from Lahore</h2>
<p>
    Bhagat Singh and Rajguru, both carrying loaded revolvers, left the house early the next day.Dressed in western attire (Bhagat Singh cut his hair, shaved his
     beard and wore a hat over cropped hair), and carrying Devi's sleeping child, Singh and Devi passed as a young couple, while Rajguru carried their luggage as their
      servant. At the station, Singh managed to conceal his identity while buying tickets, and the three boarded the train heading to Cawnpore (now Kanpur). There they
    boarded a train for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah railway station usually scrutinised passengers on the direct train from Lahore. At Lucknow, Rajguru left
     separately for Benares while Singh, Devi and the infant went to Howrah, with all except Singh returning to Lahore a few days later.
</p>
<h2>Delhi Assembly bombing and arrest</h2>
<p>
    For some time, Bhagat Singh had been exploiting the power of drama as a means to inspire the revolt against the British, purchasing a magic lantern to show slides 
    that enlivened his talks about revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil who had died as a result of the Kakori conspiracy. In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act to 
    the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims. Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in Paris,
     Singh's plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly. The nominal intention was to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and the Trade
     Dispute Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were being enacted by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual intention was for the perpetrators
     to allow themselves to be arrested so that they could use court appearances as a stage to publicise their cause.
</p>
<h2>Arrest of associates</h2>
<p>
    In 1929, the HSRA had set up bomb factories in Lahore and Saharanpur. On 15 April 1929, the Lahore bomb factory was discovered by the police, leading to the arrest
     of other members of HSRA, including Sukhdev, Kishori Lal, and Jai Gopal. Not long after this, the Saharanpur factory was also raided and some of the conspirators 
     became informants. With the new information available, the police were able to connect the three strands of the Saunders murder, Assembly bombing, and bomb 
     manufacture.[26] Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, and 21 others were charged with the Saunders murder.
</p>
<h2>Films and television</h2>
<p>
    Several films have been made portraying the life and times of Singh. The first film based on his life was Shaheed-e-Azad Bhagat Singh (1954) in which Prem Adeeb 
    played the role of Singh followed by Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1963), starring Shammi Kapoor as Bhagat Singh, Shaheed (1965) in which Manoj Kumar portrayed Bhagat Singh
     and Amar Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1974) in which Som Dutt portrays Singh. Three films about Singh were released in 2002 Shaheed-E-Azam, 23 March 1931: Shaheed and 
     The Legend of Bhagat Singh in which Singh was portrayed by Sonu Sood, Bobby Deol and Ajay Devgn respectively. Bhagat Singh (2002), a drama film directed
      by Anand Sagar and written/produced Ramanand Sagar was aired on DD National.
</p>
<h2>Songs</h2>
<p>Although not written by Singh, the patriotic Hindustani songs,<i>"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna" </i> ("The desire to sacrifice") created by<b> Bismil Azimabadi</b>,and 
    <i>"Mera Rang De Basanti Chola" </i>("O Mother! Dye my robe the colour of spring") created by <b>Ram Prasad Bismil</b>, are largely associated with him and have been used 
    in a number of related films</p>
